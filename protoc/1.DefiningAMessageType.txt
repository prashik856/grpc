Let's say you want to define a search request message format, where each search request has a query string, the particular page of results you are interested in, and a number of results per page.
Here's the .proto file you use to define the message type.
(SearchRequest.proto)


Specying Field Types:


Assigning Field Numbers:
As you can see, each field in the message definition has a unique number.
Note that field numbers in the range 1 through 15 take one byte to encode, including the field number and the field's type
Field numbers in the range 16 through 2047 take two bytes. So you should reserve the numbers 1 through 15 for very frequently occurring message elements.


Specifying Field Rules:
singular: a well-formed message can have zero or one of this field (but not more than one). And this is the default field rule for proto3 syntax.
repeated: this field can be repeated any number of times (including zero) in a well-formed message. The order of the repeated values will be preserved.

Adding more message types:
Multiple message types can be defined in a single .proto file. 
This is useful if you are defining multiple related messages â€“ so, for example, if you wanted to define the reply message format 
that corresponds to your SearchResponse message type, you could add it to the same .proto:



Adding Comments:
We can add C or C++ style comments in .proto files.
